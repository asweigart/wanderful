# Wanderful
Wanderful is an adventure and events discovery page designed to make planning excursions more fun and efficient. Users search by location and date, and the app curates local listings of the highest rated attractions for the given location, and events for that date. Each search result includes details and a map to make navigation easy. The app helps users avoid the endless loop of re-saving and re-finding travel information, since they can save search results to their agenda to view later on a single page. Users can send themselves SMS reminders about upcoming saved events or invite their friends. Wanderful helps users save time by providing a one stop place to find, save and be reminded of all of the adventures they want to go on.
